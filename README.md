# Emotion Classification from Social Media Usage 

This project explores whether emotional states can be predicted using only **behavioral metrics from social media**, such as usage time, messaging frequency, and likes received. Using a Kaggle dataset of 1,000 users, we trained and compared **48 supervised machine learning models**.

## Key Features
- Dataset: "Social Media Usage and Emotional Well-Being" by Emirhan Bulut (Kaggle)
- Models: KNN, Neural Networks, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
- Best Model: **KNN (k=6)** with **85% accuracy**
- Focus: Predict emotions (Happiness, Sadness, Anxiety, etc.) using only numeric user behavior data

## Main Findings
- Emotions like **Happiness**, **Anxiety**, and **Sadness** are strongly distinguishable via digital behavior
- Linear models underperformed due to non-linear data patterns
- Behavior-based ML can potentially support ethical emotion-aware systems

## Files Included
- `emotion_model.ipynb`: Full code for model building, evaluation, and visualization
- `confusion_matrix.jpeg`: Visual performance of best model
- `Beyond_Posts_and_Likes.pdf`: Final research paper (optional)
